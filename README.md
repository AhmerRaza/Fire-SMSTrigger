Fire-SMSTrigger
===============

Applicaiton files for georpocessing near real time fire data. 

This application glues together several components
a) FrontlineSMS http triggers
b) Esri Arcpy for geoprocessing point events on the server
c) .Net application (C#) to manage the logic of taking http triggers and processing events.

This was created in 2012 as a sample application and could probably use some updates.
